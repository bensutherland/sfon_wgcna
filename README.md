# **WGCNA Analysis for Brook Charr** #

See source for folder 01_scripts to find an early preliminary draft for the WGCNA analysis of male Brook Charr.


TODO:    
1. Determine best way to map data for use in WGCNA that can be the same for both species    
2. Test mapping efficiency to either reference genome (substantial difference?)
